# Federation 2 Composition Examples

## Contents

- various examples of subgraphs with supergraph.yaml config that can be used with the `rover supergraph` subcommand. See the main [README.md](/README.md#prerequisites) for rover install instructions.

## Using the `rover` CLI with the examples

Run an example:

```
cd ./basic

rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml
```

Verify it composes successfully:

```
rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml
WARN: [InconsistentFieldType]: Field "A.v1" has mismatched, but compatible, types across subgraphs: will use type "Int" (from subgraph "a") in supergraph but "A.v1" has subtype "Int!" in subgraph "b"

CoreSchema:

  @join__type(graph: B, key: "k")

  v3: Int @join__field(graph: B)
}

enum core__Purpose {
  """

  SECURITY

  EXECUTION
}

scalar join__FieldSet

enum join__Graph {
  A @join__graph(name: "a", url: "http://a:4000/graphql")
  B @join__graph(name: "b", url: "http://b:4000/graphql")
}

type Query
  @join__type(graph: A)
  @join__type(graph: B)
{
  a: A! @join__field(graph: A)
}
```

Done!
